                                        GTU Calculator Machine
                                        Overview

This program is a calculator that allows the user to perform a variety of mathematical operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, power calculations, finding the average of numbers, and identifying the maximum value from a set of numbers. The program provides a menu-based interface to guide the user through selecting different operations. It has robust input validation to ensure that invalid values are handled gracefully.

                                        Features
1)Addition: Adds two floating-point numbers.

2)Subtraction: Subtracts two floating-point numbers.

3)Multiplication: Multiplies two floating-point numbers.

4)Division: Divides two floating-point numbers, ensuring the divisor is not zero.

5)Power Calculation: Raises a number to a given power, supporting both positive and negative exponents.

6)Average Calculation: Computes the average of a set of floating-point numbers. Users can either enter a predefined number of inputs or add numbers interactively.

7)Maximum Finder: Identifies the maximum value in a list of floating-point numbers, either predefined or interactively entered by the user.

                                        Input Validation
-The program ensures that inputs are valid numbers for all operations.

-For division, the program checks that the divisor is not zero, as division by zero is undefined.

-Power calculation handles edge cases, including zero raised to various powers and negative powers.
                                        Menu System
-The program features a simple and user-friendly menu that displays the available operations.

-After each operation, the program asks if the user wants to perform another operation or exit.

-Invalid inputs in the menu selection are caught, and the user is prompted to re-enter a valid option.
